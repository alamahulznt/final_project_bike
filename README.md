# PROYEK DATA ANALISIS E-BIKE

This is my final project for Dicoding's "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course, where I conducted an analysis of a bike-sharing dataset and built a dashboard. In this notebook, I outline the steps I took, including Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. I also developed a dashboard using Streamlit, which can be accessed through the link in the right sidebar or [here](https://finalprojectbike-banji2dhx5khckgmsxuygp.streamlit.app/).

For further information about the dataset, such as its background, characteristics, and file structure, please refer to the Readme file.

## 2. Project Work Cycle
1. **Data Wrangling:**
    - Gathering data
    - Assessing data
    - Cleaning data
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Defined business questions for data exploration
    - Created Data exploration
3. **Data Visualization:**
    - Created Data Visualization that answers business questions
4. **Dashboard:**
    - Set up the DataFrame which will be used
    - Made filter components on the dashboard
    - Completed the dashboard with various data visualizations  

*Note: Steps 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise, and step 4 is in the dashboard.*

## 3. Getting Started with Proyek_Analisis_Data_Wildan_Sibil_Danillah_Safri.ipynb
1. Download this project.
2. Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (I am using Google Colab here).
3. Create a New Notebook.
4. Upload and select the file with the .ipynb extension.
5. Connect to the hosted runtime.
6. Lastly, run the code cells.

## 4. Running the Dashboard (dashboard/dashboard.py)
1. Download this project.
2. Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using pip install streamlit. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it streamlit run dashboard.py.
